<!-- TODO: so next, I want to be able to click on a profile name or image on a post, and be taken to the corresponding profile PAGE. On this page, I want to have a bio section with info on the user, and display all of their posts below that. To display all of the user's posts, I will have to make a function getPostByCreator I think? This will entail finding all that posts that include the specific creatorId from the profile page that we are on. -->

<!-- NOTE: make sure to add your page to your router. -->
